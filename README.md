# vga_project

So, you wanna work on the VGA project? Awesome! A couple of tips to help you get started because I did not comment my code very well at all and it might be confusing.

For those of you working on sprite animation, the latest commit to top.v has the sprite animation code in it, but commented out. Some aspects of the code may be unclear to some of you so if you need to reach me to ask any questions at all, my email is tishbik1@tcnj.edu . 
There used to be a design source for the project called clock_divider.v and I urge you not to use it. Delete it from your project, this component was replaced by the clock wizard IP.
